# Probability & Gradient Descent 
## Contents
### Part 1: Probability Distributions
Includes implementations of probability distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson, or Exponential) using raw Python. Real-world examples are provided along with graph visualizations using matplotlib.

### Part 2: Bayesian Probability
Demonstrates Bayesian reasoning applied to a real-world scenario. Shows prior, likelihood, and posterior updates step-by-step, along with explanations of practical relevance.

### Part 3: Manual Gradient Descent
Presents detailed, manual calculations for three iterations of gradient descent in linear regression. Includes intermediate values for m, b, predictions, gradients, and error.

### Part 4: Gradient Descent in Code
Contains Python code that replicates the manual gradient descent steps using SciPy. Visualizes how m, b, and the error change over iterations using matplotlib.
